# Rick and Morty: Space Adventures
Welcome to Rick and Morty: Space Adventures! A space-themed arcade game developed using C++ and the Simple Game Graphics Library (SGG). In this game, you'll be cruising through space as Rick, driving his spacecraft to avoid incoming comets and capture crystals.

## Gameplay

You'll be cruising through space as Rick, driving his spacecraft to avoid incoming comets and capture crystals. There are two types of crystals: the Green Crystal and the Energy Crystal. The Green Crystal will heal damage to your spacecraft caused by comets, while the Energy Crystal will give energy to your spacecraft to keep it floating. As time passes, your spacecraft will run out of energy, and if the energy capacity reaches zero or your health runs out, you'll lose the game. The goal is to make a high score by avoiding comets and capturing crystals, with the score being determined by points. You'll gain one point for each comet you avoid. As your score grows, the comets and crystals will start passing by faster, making it more difficult to avoid comets and capture crystals.

The game also features real vocals from the Rick and Morty show, adding a layer of humor and entertainment to the game. When you crash comets or capture crystals, you'll hear funny and entertaining quotes from the show.

## User Interface
The game features a user-friendly interface with a graphical user interface (GUI) on the top left corner. The GUI displays two bars that represent the percentage of life remaining on the spacecraft and the energy of the spacecraft's battery. Keep an eye on these bars to ensure that your spacecraft stays afloat and avoid losing the game!
